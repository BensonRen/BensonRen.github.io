Hi, welcome to Ben's personal little place, where I keep all my dirty secrets... just joking... where I keep all sorts of information for your reference

My Motto: "Imagine a world with you and without you, what's the difference?"

Coming from a physics background (Department of Applied Physics in Hong Kong PolyU), I switched to the field of data science and machine learning in my graduate life at Duke, wishing to make a practical difference to the current world with the power of machine learning and big data. That's where I joined the [Applied Machine Learning Lab (AMLL)](https://amll.pratt.duke.edu/) lead by Prof. Leslie Collins (I am co-supervised by Prof. Jordan Malof) and start focusing on using AI to solve important problems facing the current society like material discovery and energy.

Check out my CV and publication list on the top buttons. This is a first attempt for my personal webiste and please bear with me : )
