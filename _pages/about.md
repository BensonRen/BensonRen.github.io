Hi, welcome to Ben's personal website. I am a third year PhD student in Applied Machine Learning Lab in Duke University, Electrical and Computer Engineering department.

My Motto: "Imagine a world with you and without you, what's the difference?"

Coming from a physics background (Department of Applied Physics in Hong Kong PolyU), I switched to the field of data science and machine learning in my graduate life at Duke, wishing to make a practical difference to the current world with the power of machine learning and big data. That's where I joined the [Applied Machine Learning Lab (AMLL)](https://amll.pratt.duke.edu/) lead by Prof. Leslie Collins (I am co-supervised by Prof. Jordan Malof) and start focusing on using AI to solve important problems facing the current society like material discovery and energy.
